                        One way of determining which academic fields best suit you is to take a close look at your class
                        grades in high school. Doing this can highlight your strengths in specific academic areas.

                    <p>Some majors may feel harder than others based on factors like typical homework load, course
                        expectations, and frequency of exams. Your core classes (i.e., classes specifically related to
                        your major) will make up a significant portion of your college course load. So, before you
                        declare a major, make sure you understand how rigorous your weekly workload will be.

                    <p>Checking in with your academic advisor is one of the most important steps you can take when
                        deciding on a major. They've had similar conversations with hundreds of students and can provide
                        insightful wisdom into picking a major. Your advisor may even propose a major you hadn't
                        previously considered that meets your academic and career goals.
